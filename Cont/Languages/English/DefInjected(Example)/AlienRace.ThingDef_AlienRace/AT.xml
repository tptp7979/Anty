  <Anty.description>Anties are genetically engineered beings by a private company to replace dying soldiers on the battle field.\n\nEverything has gone south when the company has let their guard down to celebrate their recent progress. Due to a mistake made by one of the employees, the Anties have been set free from the lab and ended up in space.\n\nTheir personalities are gentle by nature, but they were made to know only but war. On each planet they end up, they burn everything down to ash, using themselves as the main source of the fuel.</Anty.description>
